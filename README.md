# M Music 2.0

WMP Assignment 2

This extension of the original M Music web application allows the user to do the following:
- a) View a list of music fetched from a backend API endpoint
- b) Click on a music/song & view it's individual details
- c) Add or remove markers for each song on a Google Map page

M Music 2.0, likewise it's original version, is also still a front-end web app made using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

## Languages/Tools/Libraries used:

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery (for AJAX calls)

## Explanation of the web app's extra features:

For WMP Assignment 2, we are showed to create a webpage consisting of 3 screens:
- Listing page
- Details page
- Map page

For the Listing page, we were supposed to call a PHP endpoint (provided by the school) to fetch data containing a list of music stored in the backend server/database. Then we need to populate the returned JSON response into the UI as seen in the frontend.

For the Details page, the requirements are to display the individual song details when a user clicks on the song in the Listing page.

The Map page would allow users to add & remove 'Markers' on a Google Map. Each song will have their own individual Google Map page. The purpose of these markers for the user to take note on where a specific song can be bought in the world. It's more or less like a note-taker in short.
